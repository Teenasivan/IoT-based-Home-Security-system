# IoT-based-Home-Security-system
In this project, we will learn about how to use the Adafruit IO platform to record, analyze, and control the live data on the cloud. You can upload, display, and monitor your data over the internet and make your project IoT enabled. You can even control motors, buzzers, and sensors using it.
